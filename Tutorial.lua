While you are active on a job, you will see it highlighted in the Careers page and be able to chat with anyone else in the game doing that same job with the “/j [text]” or “/job [text]” command.

In order to find a place to work, you can view the Job Map with [J]. Each marker is a location where you can learn about a job and start it from.

Now %s you will be shown a brief lesson on how to be a Factory Worker in the nearby factory job.

Please, access your Job Map [J] and look for the Factory Worker job marker nearby us. Walk to that location and interact with the marker to accept the job.

As a Factory Worker your task will be to maintain the shipyards by repairing gas leaks. You can find them all throughout the docks but for now just focus on the ones inside the Factory next to the job marker.

Now enter the factory building. For each gas leak you fix with [E] you will be paid in VICs for your hard work. Once you reach 30 VICs we will proceed with the next part of your orientation.

Great work %s, looks delicious. It's time for us to wrap up here.

A final word of advice: there are many great benefits to be had by obtaining official citizenship as a Vaktovian, including a pathway to the military through the Vaktovian Army Corps or "VAC".

If the allure of such benefits sounds interesting, be sure to join the Imperial Vaktovia group and the Vaktovian Community Network to be notified of upcoming citizenship classes.

Citizenship classes are held at the Tamakan College in Novarsk marked as a teal C on your map.

With this, you may be ready for life at Vyyrahk. How ready you really will be shall come down to your own abilities and how you rise through the nation.

There is still much to teach you. Experts in various fields will make themselves available and deliver you information as you make a name for yourself at your jobs and within Vaktovian society.

Do remember to always follow instructions of police forces and military personnel and remain respectful so you are not mistaken for a criminal.
